For each binding to a collection inside the request's scope, only one will be reported with a 200 status, while subsequent DAV:response elements for all other bindings will use the 208 status, and no DAV:response elements for their descendants are included.</p><h5>Wikipedia</h5><p>The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous reply to this request, and are not being included again.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
