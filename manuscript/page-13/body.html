The server will switch protocols to those defined by the response's Upgrade header field immediately after the empty line which terminates the 101 response.</p><p>The protocol SHOULD be switched only when it is advantageous to do so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP is advantageous over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use such features.</p><h5>Wikipedia</h5><p>This means the requester has asked the server to switch.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
