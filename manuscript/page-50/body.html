If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.</p><p>If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the conditional.</p><p>If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the cache MUST update the entry to reflect any new field values given in the response.</p></div> </div>
