<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>428 Precondition Required</h4><p class="  start-chapter">The 428 status code indicates that the origin server requires the request to be conditional.</p><p>Its typical use is to avoid the "lost update" problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict. By requiring requests to be conditional, the server can assure that clients are working with the correct copies.</p><p>Responses using this status code SHOULD explain how to resubmit the request successfully.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The 428 status code is optional; clients cannot rely</p></div> </div>
