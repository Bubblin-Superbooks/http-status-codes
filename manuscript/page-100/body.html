The request MAY be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.</p><p>It can be used both when the set of request header fields in total are too large, and when a single header field is at fault. In the latter case, the response representation SHOULD specify which header field was too large.</p><p>Servers are not required to use the 431 status code; when under attack, it may be more appropriate to just drop connections, or take other steps.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
