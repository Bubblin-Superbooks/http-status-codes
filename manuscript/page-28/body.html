Otherwise, the response MUST include all of the entity-headers that would have been returned with a 200 (OK) response to the same request.</p><p>A cache MUST NOT combine a 206 response with other previously cached content if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly, see 13.5.4.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206</p></div> </div>
