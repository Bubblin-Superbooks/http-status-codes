<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>422 Unprocessable Entity (Webdav)</h4><p class="  start-chapter">The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415(Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions. For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous, XML instructions.</p><h5>Wikipedia</h5></div> </div>
