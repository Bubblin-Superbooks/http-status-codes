This presents many security issues; e.g., an attacking intermediary may be inserting cookies into the original domain's name space, may be observing cookies or HTTP authentication credentials sent from the user agent, and so on.</p><p>However, these risks are not unique to the 511 status code; in other words, a captive portal that is not using this status code introduces the same issues.</p><p>Also, note that captive portals using this status code on an SSL or TLS connection (commonly, port 443) will generate a certificate error on the client.</p><h5>Wikipedia</h5></div> </div>
