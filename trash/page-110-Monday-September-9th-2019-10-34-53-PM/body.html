<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>511 Network Authentication Required</h4><p class="  start-chapter">The 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.</p><p>The response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that allows the user to submit credentials (e.g. with a HTML form).</p><p>Note that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the login interface itself, because browsers would show the login interface as being associated with the originally requested URL, which may cause confusion.</p><p>The 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by origin servers; it is intended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a means of controlling access to the network.</p><p>Responses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.</p></div> </div>
